### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench是首个专注于印度次大陆的大规模多模态基准测试，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、MMT和VQA三种任务，共约5K图像和37K+问答对，评估了8个模型在文化多样性环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型(VLMs)的评估基准大多以西方为中心，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言环境的测试，需要建立更包容的评估框架。

Method: 构建IndicVisionBench基准，覆盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、MMT和VQA三种多模态任务，涉及13个文化相关主题，并发布10种印度语言的并行标注语料库。

Result: 评估了8个模型（包括专有闭源系统和开源模型），发现当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench通过关注文化多样性和多语言性，为更包容的多模态研究建立了可复现的评估框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为条件偏好优化（CPO）的新方法，通过直接优化控制条件而非生成图像来提升文本到图像生成的可控性，相比现有方法在多个控制类型上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++仅优化低噪声时间步，忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献并引入近似误差；而直接偏好优化（DPO）方法难以确保图像对仅在可控性上存在差异，其他因素如图像质量保持不变。

Method: 提出条件偏好优化（CPO），通过构建获胜和失败的控制信号（c^w和c^l），训练模型偏好c^w，消除混杂因素并降低训练目标的方差。

Result: 在多个控制类型上显著优于最先进的ControlNet++：分割任务错误率降低超过10%，人体姿态任务降低70-80%，边缘和深度图任务一致降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO方法在理论上展示出比DPO更低的对比损失方差，实证结果优越，且需要更少的计算和存储资源用于数据集构建。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [3] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN是一种新颖的解码器架构，通过动态自适应正则化解决卫星图像异质性问题，在完全微调和高效适应两种范式下都取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基础模型适应方法采用固定正则化策略，无法处理卫星图像的显著异质性，限制了模型性能。

Method: DARN包含三个关键创新：轻量级任务复杂度预测器、自适应dropout调制和动态容量门控，通过理论证明与自适应信息瓶颈机制相关联。

Result: 在完全微调模式下，DARN在GeoBench基准上达到86.66% mIoU的新SOTA；在高效适应模式下，在Sen1Floods11上达到90.5% mIoU，并在OOD泛化、鲁棒性和少数类性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DARN为关键地理空间应用提供了更智能、鲁棒和高效的基础模型利用方法。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于预训练-微调框架的机器学习方法，从全球多卫星2D图像生成3D云图，首次实现全球瞬时3D云图重建，特别针对热带气旋等强风暴进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋预报面临卫星观测有限和云属性解析困难的挑战，现有方法在强风暴区域验证不足，需要开发能够准确重建强风暴3D结构的全球性方法。

Method: 采用预训练-微调管道，利用全球覆盖的多卫星数据，将2D卫星图像转换为相关云属性的3D云图，并在定制热带气旋数据集上进行评估。

Result: 首次创建全球瞬时3D云图，准确重建强风暴的3D结构，不仅扩展了可用卫星观测，还能在观测完全缺失时提供估计。

Conclusion: 该方法对增进热带气旋强度变化理解和改进预报至关重要，为强风暴研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

### [5] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [6] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过Cellpose案例研究，分析了生物医学图像分割中的两个关键挑战：训练数据冗余和跨域迁移中的模型遗忘问题。研究发现仅需10%数据即可达到性能饱和，并提出数据集量化策略和选择性重放方法来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索生物医学图像分割模型中训练数据冗余的程度，以及跨域迁移对模型保留能力的影响，旨在提高训练效率和模型泛化能力。

Method: 采用数据集量化策略构建紧凑多样的训练子集，通过潜在空间分析和t-SNE验证特征多样性。进行跨域微调实验，使用选择性重放方法缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 实验表明图像分割性能在仅使用10%数据时即达到饱和，证实了显著的数据冗余。选择性重放5-10%源数据能有效恢复源域性能，而训练域排序可改善泛化并减少遗忘。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的设计在生物医学图像分割中的重要性，表明高效训练不仅需要紧凑子集，还需要保留感知的学习策略和明智的域排序方法。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [7] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合主动学习和伪标注的数据中心AI工作流，利用基础模型生成伪标注来配置nnU-Net，然后选择代表性核心集进行少量人工标注，显著减少标注需求并保持竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决nnU-Net需要大量标注数据进行交叉验证的挑战，以及基础模型在特定数据集上可能表现不佳的问题，为生物医学研究者提供更易用的AI分割解决方案。

Method: 使用基础模型生成伪标注来配置nnU-Net，然后通过主动学习选择代表性核心集进行少量人工标注，最后微调nnU-Net模型。

Result: 该方法显著减少了手动标注的需求，同时保持了竞争性的分割性能。

Conclusion: 该工作流为生物医学研究者提供了应用最先进AI技术的可访问解决方案，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/AL_BioMed_img_seg.

*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于表面法向量先验知识的几何去噪新范式，通过标签向量集进行自然分割，使用总变差正则化，采用分裂Bregman方法求解优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用表面法向量的先验知识来改进几何去噪效果，将分割问题自然地嵌入到去噪过程中。

Method: 使用标签向量集作为法向量先验，基于法向量与标签向量的相似性进行分割，采用总变差正则化，通过分裂Bregman（ADMM）方法求解优化问题，顶点更新基于二阶形状计算。

Result: 该方法能够同时实现几何去噪和分割，通过先验法向量知识提升去噪质量。

Conclusion: 提出的基于法向量先验的几何去噪范式有效结合了去噪和分割任务，分裂Bregman方法能够高效求解相应的优化问题。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

### [9] [Clinical-ComBAT: a diffusion-weighted MRI harmonization method for clinical applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04871)
*Gabriel Girard,Manon Edde,Félix Dumais,Yoan David,Matthieu Dumont,Guillaume Theaud,Jean-Christophe Houde,Arnaud Boré,Maxime Descoteaux,Pierre-Marc Jodoin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Clinical-ComBAT方法，用于解决DW-MRI数据在多站点采集时的扫描仪偏差问题，相比传统ComBAT方法更适合临床实际应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ComBAT方法在线性协变量关系、同质人群、固定站点数量和充分数据量等方面存在限制，难以适应临床实际需求，需要开发更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用非线性多项式数据模型，以规范站点为参考进行站点特异性协调，包含可适应小样本的方差先验、超参数调优和协调质量评估指标。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证了方法的有效性，显示扩散指标对齐效果改善，并增强了规范建模的适用性。

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT方法能够有效解决多站点DW-MRI数据的协调问题，为临床实践提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future
research in AI dentistry.

*Tharindu Fernando,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习的新型深度学习框架，用于开发鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，以解决深度伪造检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展导致深度伪造越来越逼真，给执法和公众信任带来挑战。现有的被动深度伪造检测器难以跟上发展步伐，因为它们依赖特定的伪造伪影，限制了其泛化到新型深度伪造的能力。主动水印检测方法在平衡对良性失真的鲁棒性和对恶意篡改的敏感性方面存在困难。

Method: 开发了一种在潜在空间中操作的可学习水印嵌入器，捕获高级图像语义，同时提供对消息编码和提取的精确控制。采用多智能体对抗强化学习范式，使可学习水印智能体通过与由对抗攻击者智能体模拟的良性和恶意图像操作动态课程交互，追求鲁棒性和脆弱性之间的最优平衡。

Result: 在CelebA和CelebA-HQ基准上的综合评估表明，该方法始终优于最先进的方法，在具有挑战性的操作场景下，在CelebA上实现了超过4.5%的改进，在CelebA-HQ上实现了超过5.3%的改进。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过结合高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习，成功开发了一种鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，有效解决了深度伪造检测中的关键挑战，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

### [12] [CLM: Removing the GPU Memory Barrier for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04951)
*Hexu Zhao,Xiwen Min,Xiaoteng Liu,Moonjun Gong,Yiming Li,Ang Li,Saining Xie,Jinyang Li,Aurojit Panda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLM系统通过将Gaussians卸载到CPU内存，仅在需要时加载到GPU内存，使3DGS能够在单个消费级GPU上渲染大型场景，解决了3DGS内存需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在渲染大型场景时内存需求过大，超出大多数GPU的内存容量，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 利用3DGS内存访问模式进行流水线化，重叠GPU-CPU通信、GPU计算和CPU计算，同时减少通信量。

Result: 能够在单个RTX4090上渲染需要1亿个Gaussians的大型场景，并实现最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统成功解决了3DGS在大型场景中的内存限制问题，使其能够在消费级硬件上高效运行。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

### [13] [GSE: Evaluating Sticker Visual Semantic Similarity via a General Sticker Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04977)
*Heng Er Metilda Chee,Jiayin Wang,Zhiqiang Guo,Weizhi Ma,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了贴纸语义相似性任务的定义，创建了首个基准数据集Triple-S，并开发了轻量级通用贴纸编码器GSE，在贴纸理解和检索任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贴纸已成为流行的视觉交流形式，但由于其高度多样化和符号化内容，理解其语义关系仍然具有挑战性。现有预训练视觉和多模态模型难以捕捉贴纸的细微语义。

Method: 正式定义贴纸语义相似性任务，构建包含905个人工标注正负贴纸对的Triple-S基准数据集，提出轻量级通用贴纸编码器GSE，利用Triple-S和额外数据集学习鲁棒的贴纸嵌入表示。

Result: GSE在未见过的贴纸上实现卓越性能，在情感分类和贴纸到贴纸检索等下游任务上表现强劲。现有预训练模型在捕捉贴纸细微语义方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 通过发布Triple-S和GSE，为贴纸理解、检索和多模态内容生成的未来研究提供了标准化评估工具和鲁棒嵌入表示。

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are
available here.

TL;DR: 本文发现主流LVLM架构存在对语言模态的固有偏见，并提出通过整合平均池化视觉特征来优化文本嵌入的方法，显著改善了视觉定位并减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主流LVLM架构中因简单将视觉嵌入附加到输入文本序列而产生的语言模态偏见问题，这种偏见导致了视觉定位不佳和幻觉现象。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的方法，通过整合平均池化的视觉特征来优化文本嵌入，从而改善跨模态对齐。

Result: 该方法在已有基准测试中显著改善了视觉定位能力，并大幅减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化提供了一种简单、鲁棒且高效的视觉信息整合方式，但更复杂的融合方法可能进一步改善视觉定位和跨模态对齐，这留待未来工作探索。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态残差编码与切片级对比学习（DRE-SLCL）方法，用于端到端的全切片图像（WSI）表示学习，解决了GPU内存限制下无法同时处理所有图像块的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练端到端的WSI表示模型面临重大挑战，因为标准千兆像素切片包含数万个图像块，由于当前GPU限制，难以在单个小批量中计算所有块的梯度。

Method: 使用内存库存储数据集中所有WSI的块特征。训练时，每个小批量包含多个WSI，随机采样部分块计算特征，同时从内存库中选择同一WSI的额外块特征，通过残差编码技术结合采样特征和检索特征生成WSI表示，最后基于小批量内WSI的表示和病理报告计算切片级对比损失。

Result: 在癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测任务上的实验证明了所提DRE-SLCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法能够有效解决WSI表示学习中的计算挑战，并在多个病理分析任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

TL;DR: Pressure2Motion是一个从地面压力序列和文本提示生成人体运动的新型运动捕捉算法，无需特殊设备，适用于隐私保护、低光照和低成本场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统运动捕捉需要专业设备（如摄像头、可穿戴设备）的问题，提供一种更便捷、隐私友好的替代方案，同时应对压力信号到全身运动的不确定性挑战。

Method: 采用双级特征提取器解析压力数据，结合分层扩散模型识别运动轨迹和姿态调整，利用物理线索和语义指导进行精确运动生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成高保真、物理合理的运动，在该任务上建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是利用压力数据和语言先验进行运动生成的先驱工作，建立的MPL基准是该任务的第一个基准，代码和基准将在发表后公开。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: NTP-MRISeg将医学参考图像分割重新表述为统一多模态序列上的自回归下一个标记预测任务，简化了模型设计并支持端到端训练，通过三种新策略解决暴露偏差、长尾分布和细粒度边界问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学参考图像分割方法通常涉及复杂的多模态融合或多阶段解码器设计，作者希望提出更简化的统一框架。

Method: 将MRIS重新表述为自回归下一个标记预测任务，使用统一的多模态序列（图像、文本和掩码标记），并提出三种策略：Next-k Token Prediction减少累积误差、Token-level Contrastive Learning增强边界敏感性和缓解长尾分布、Hard Error Token优化策略强调困难标记。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上的广泛实验表明，NTP-MRISeg实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg为传统MRIS流程提供了一个简化和有效的替代方案，通过统一的自回归框架和专门的优化策略取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP是一个新颖的数据合成框架，通过多视角角色扮演提示引导多模态大语言模型生成语义多样的图像描述，提升CLIP模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，但往往导致语义多样性有限和描述冗余浅显，需要提升合成数据的语义多样性和细粒度对齐。

Method: 使用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释器等）引导MLLMs从不同视角生成语义多样的图像描述，增强图像-文本对的语义多样性和细粒度对齐。

Result: 在仅使用100万对Role-SynthCLIP数据训练的CLIP-B/16模型上，在MS COCO验证集上达到64.1%的Recall@1，比现有最佳合成数据基线（使用500万对数据）高出2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP通过多视角角色扮演提示有效提升了合成数据的语义多样性和质量，在保持数据量不变的情况下显著提高了CLIP模型的性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个双层次强化学习框架，通过构建高保真天气数据集HFLS-Weather，在局部层次优化天气特定恢复模型，在全局层次动态协调模型选择和执行顺序，实现了对恶劣天气条件下视觉感知的持续适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气严重损害真实世界的视觉感知，而现有基于合成数据训练的视觉模型难以泛化到复杂的退化情况。

Method: 首先构建物理驱动的高保真天气数据集HFLS-Weather，然后设计双层次强化学习框架：局部层次通过扰动驱动的图像质量优化来精炼天气特定恢复模型；全局层次通过元控制器根据场景退化动态协调模型选择和执行顺序。

Result: 该框架能够持续适应真实世界条件，在广泛的恶劣天气场景中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次强化学习框架有效解决了恶劣天气下视觉感知的泛化问题，实现了对复杂退化条件的持续适应能力。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

Conclusion: 为冬季场景下可靠的车道检测建立了坚实基础，为全天候自动驾驶研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将可变形高斯泼溅分为前景和背景组件的方法，通过稀疏掩码分离训练，在稀疏相机配置下实现高质量动态3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电影制作中预算有限导致的稀疏相机配置问题，传统方法在捕捉复杂动态特征时表现受限。

Method: 使用稀疏掩码将规范高斯和变形场分为前景和背景组件，分别在不同损失函数下训练，前景学习颜色、位置和旋转变化，背景仅学习位置变化。

Result: 在3D和2.5D娱乐数据集上实现最先进的定性和定量结果，PSNR提高达3，模型大小减半，并能生成分割的动态重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏相机配置下优于现有技术，无需密集掩码监督即可生成包含透明和动态纹理的分割动态重建。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

TL;DR: BRIXEL是一种简单的知识蒸馏方法，通过让学生模型学习在更高分辨率下复现自身的特征图，解决了DINOv3模型在高分辨率下计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DINOv3模型需要高分辨率输入图像和大量计算资源，这限制了其在实际应用中的使用。为了解决计算复杂度和资源需求问题，提出了BRIXEL方法。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏方法，训练学生模型学习在更高分辨率下复现其自身的特征图，从而在保持分辨率固定的情况下提升性能。

Result: BRIXEL在固定分辨率的下游任务上显著优于基线DINOv3模型，且能以较低计算成本生成与教师模型相似的特征图。

Conclusion: BRIXEL提供了一种有效的方法来降低视觉基础模型的计算成本，同时保持甚至提升性能，为实际部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Conclusion: MUSE通过创新的自监督学习框架，成功解决了组织病理学分析中细胞核检测和分类的关键问题，为病理学应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展原版Walk the Lines算法的应用范围，使其不仅限于彩色图像中的船舶分割，还能适应红外图像和RGB图像中的多种目标，提供更详细的分割结果。

Method: 通过轮廓跟踪替代传统的非极大值抑制(NMS)，将目标轮廓细化到1像素宽的闭合形状，在前景-背景场景中形成可分割区域。算法适配了红外船舶的输入轮廓检测器，并增强了对RGB图像中多种目标的处理能力。

Conclusion: WtL2成为需要详细分割或高质量样本的专业应用中的有力方法，有望加速图像分割在多个专业领域的发展。

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet依赖手工条件图和重新训练，灵活性有限；基于反转的方法对齐效果好但推理成本高。需要一种无需训练且高效的控制方法。

Method: FreeControl采用单步注意力提取，从最优关键时间步提取注意力并在整个去噪过程中复用；引入潜在条件解耦(LCD)分离关键时间步和噪声潜在，提高质量和稳定性；支持通过多源参考图像进行组合控制。

Result: 实现了结构和语义对齐的视觉连贯生成，直接从原始图像生成，支持直观的场景布局设计，与现代扩散模型兼容且仅增加约5%的计算成本。

Conclusion: FreeControl为测试时控制引入了新范式，无需反转或重新训练即可实现高效的结构和语义控制，具有灵活的组合设计能力。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Motivation: 解决单目视频中动态场景的新视角合成问题，现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在动态内容和未知相机位姿方面存在局限，需要开发能够同时处理动态内容和位姿估计的框架。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先利用3D基础模型进行初始位姿和几何估计，然后进行运动感知细化。关键创新包括运动感知束调整模块（结合transformer先验和SAM2进行动态对象分割）和运动感知高斯溅射表示（使用控制点和变形场MLP建模动态运动）。

Result: 在真实世界动态数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法PSNR提升达1.8dB，在具有大动态对象的挑战性场景中表现尤其突出，同时计算需求比先前动态场景表示减少5倍。

Conclusion: 4D3R框架在无需预计算相机位姿的情况下，有效解决了动态场景的新视角合成问题，在重建质量和计算效率方面均取得显著改进。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于3D U-Net的自动分割方法，用于结直肠肝转移瘤(CRLM)的术中超声图像分割。通过裁剪策略优化模型性能，在85例患者数据上验证，实现了接近专家水平的准确度，且处理速度比半自动方法快4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中准确界定结直肠肝转移瘤对于实现阴性切除边缘至关重要，但由于术中超声图像对比度低、噪声大且依赖操作者，这一任务具有挑战性。自动分割可以提升超声导航工作流程的精确性和效率。

Method: 使用85例CRLM患者的追踪3D术中超声数据，通过nnU-Net框架实现3D U-Net。比较了两种变体：在全超声体积上训练和在肿瘤周围裁剪区域上训练。使用Dice相似系数、Hausdorff距离和相对体积差异评估分割准确性，并集成到3D Slicer中用于实时术中应用。

Result: 裁剪体积模型在所有指标上显著优于全体积模型(AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718)。达到中位DSC = 0.74，召回率 = 0.79，Hausdorff距离 = 17.1 mm，与半自动分割相当但执行速度快约4倍(~1分钟)。前瞻性术中测试证实了稳健一致的性能。

Conclusion: 使用裁剪3D U-Net对术中超声中的CRLM进行自动3D分割，提供了可靠、接近实时的结果，且操作者输入最少。该方法实现了高效、无需配准的超声导航，接近专家级准确度，同时显著减少手动工作量和手术时间。

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuisineSense是一个通过智能手表和智能眼镜集成手部动作与头部动态来分类中餐类型的系统，采用两阶段检测流程，在27.5小时的数据集上实现了高精度的进食状态检测和食物分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自我报告方法存在回忆偏差，基于摄像头的方法涉及隐私问题，现有可穿戴方法主要针对有限食物类型，无法应对中餐的多样性。

Method: 集成智能手表的手部动作和智能眼镜的头部动态，设计两阶段检测流程：第一阶段识别进食状态，第二阶段进行细粒度食物类型识别。

Result: 在包含11种食物类别和10名参与者的27.5小时IMU记录数据集上，CuisineSense在进食状态检测和食物分类方面均实现了高精度。

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了一个实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了现有点云生成评估指标（特别是基于Chamfer Distance的指标）的不足，提出了改进的评估方法（DCD和SNC），并开发了新的生成架构Diffusion Point Transformer，在ShapeNet数据集上实现了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D点云技术的广泛应用，需要更可靠的生成模型评估指标和更高质量的生成方法。现有基于Chamfer Distance的指标对缺陷不鲁棒，无法充分捕捉几何保真度和局部形状一致性。

Method: 1）提出在距离计算前引入样本对齐；2）用密度感知Chamfer距离（DCD）替代传统CD；3）提出表面法线一致性（SNC）指标；4）基于transformer模型开发Diffusion Point Transformer生成架构。

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在生成点云质量方面优于先前解决方案，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估指标和开发新的生成架构，本文为点云生成提供了更可靠的评估方法和更高质量的生成结果，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

Conclusion: 该方法为语义隐写开辟了新方向，能够处理语义丰富的内容，源代码即将发布。

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Artic4D数据集和CanonSeg4D框架，用于4D铰接物体全景分割，通过将观测物体部分映射到标准空间来提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了铰接物体的时间动态特性，且缺乏4D全景分割的基准数据集，阻碍了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出CanonSeg4D框架，通过估计每帧偏移将观测物体部分映射到学习的标准空间，实现跨帧一致的物体部分对齐。

Result: 在Artic4D数据集上的实验表明，CanonSeg4D在复杂场景下的全景分割精度优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 时间建模和标准对齐在动态物体理解中具有显著效果，为4D铰接物体感知的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

Conclusion: 本研究填补了3D运动理解领域的空白，通过CompMo数据集和DEMO模型为密集运动描述任务提供了有效的解决方案，推动了3D人体运动与语言整合研究的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1是一个基于偏好-响应解耦强化学习的视觉质量评估框架，统一了绝对分数回归和相对排序一致性，在图像和视频质量评估任务上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排序目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨域泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出偏好-响应解耦强化学习框架，采用双分支奖励公式分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化进行优化，并设计了全局-时序和局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估。

Result: 仅用6K图像和28K视频进行强化微调，在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，IQA任务的SRCC和PLCC指标分别提升了5.30%和2.15%。

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1不仅实现了定量性能提升，还产生了与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示了质量判断背后的感知线索。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

Conclusion: PALM的规模和多样性使其成为手部建模及相关研究的宝贵真实世界资源。

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

TL;DR: MPRF是一个多模态闭环检测管道，结合视觉和LiDAR模态，在非结构化环境中实现鲁棒的闭环检测和6-DoF位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒绝环境（如行星探测）中，视觉位置识别因混叠和弱纹理而失效，LiDAR方法则受稀疏性和模糊性影响，需要更鲁棒的闭环检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段视觉检索策略：使用DINOv2特征和SALAD聚合进行候选筛选，结合SONATA-based LiDAR描述符进行几何验证，并集成显式6-DoF位姿估计。

Result: 在S3LI和S3LI Vulcano数据集上，MPRF在精度上优于最先进的检索方法，在低纹理区域增强了位姿估计的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPRF在准确性、效率和可靠性之间实现了良好的平衡，展示了基础模型在统一位置识别和位姿估计方面的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

Motivation: 解决文本转说话人脸合成中的视听对齐问题，避免级联管道的误差累积，提高唇部同步和视觉真实感。

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块从文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，采用两阶段训练：先在Wav2Vec2嵌入上预训练，再在TTS输出上微调，处理特征分布偏移。

Result: 实验表明，基于TTS预测隐式特征的调节优于级联管道，显著改善了唇部同步和视觉真实感。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够生成自然、富有表现力的语音和同步的面部动作，同时保持说话人身份，无需推理时的真实音频。

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

Motivation: 现有3D点云变换器依赖密集令牌表示，导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本高昂，作者发现令牌存在显著冗余，造成效率低下。

Method: 提出gitmerge3D方法，通过全局感知的图令牌合并技术减少令牌数量，挑战了更多令牌必然带来更好性能的普遍假设。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了计算效率的一致提升，同时保持竞争性性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用中等分辨率（10米）的哥白尼计划卫星图像（Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2）进行建筑物损坏评估的可行性，并发布了xBD-S12数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害需要快速损坏评估来指导人道主义响应，但超高分辨率图像可用性有限，因此研究中等分辨率图像是否能补充支持建筑物损坏评估。

Method: 创建了包含10,315对灾前灾后图像对的xBD-S12数据集，与现有xBD基准进行时空对齐，并进行了一系列实验来评估不同模型架构的性能。

Result: 实验表明，尽管只有10米分辨率，但在许多灾害场景中能够较好地检测和绘制建筑物损坏。复杂模型架构在泛化到未见过的灾害时表现不佳，地理空间基础模型带来的实际益处有限。

Conclusion: 哥白尼图像是进行快速、大范围损坏评估的可行数据源，可以与超高分辨率图像一起发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人脸分析的图像年代估计方法，利用CSFD-1.6M数据集中的160万标注人脸，通过多个人脸信息聚合来推断照片拍摄年份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于场景的图像年代估计方法存在局限性，希望通过人脸信息（特别是多人脸）来更准确地估计照片拍摄时间。

Method: 提出概率框架，结合现代人脸识别和年龄估计模型的视觉证据，以及基于职业生涯的时间先验，来推断照片拍摄年份。

Result: 实验表明，聚合多个人脸的证据能持续提升性能，该方法显著优于基于场景的基线方法，特别是在包含多个可识别个体的图像中。

Conclusion: 基于人脸分析的图像年代估计方法有效，多人脸信息聚合能够显著提高估计准确性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经形态传感器的实时流态分类框架，利用事件数据优于传统图像方法，LSTM模型达到97.6%准确率和0.28ms处理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流沸腾是高效传热机制，但流态突变会破坏热性能，需要准确低延迟的实时监测。传统光学成像方法计算量大、时间分辨率不足，无法捕捉瞬态流动行为。

Method: 开发基于神经形态传感器信号的实时框架，传感器检测像素亮度变化对应边缘运动，无需全帧重建。构建五种分类模型，比较传统图像数据和事件数据。

Result: 利用事件数据的模型优于基于帧的方法，对动态流动特征更敏感。事件LSTM模型在准确性和速度间最佳平衡，达到97.6%分类准确率和0.28ms处理时间。

Conclusion: 异步处理管道支持连续低延迟预测，通过多数投票机制提供稳定输出，为实验控制和智能热管理提供可靠实时反馈。

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R将时序搜索重新定义为交错文本-视频思考，通过强化学习将视频片段搜索无缝集成到推理过程中，并提出GRPO-CSV方法来解决强化学习训练中的无监督中间搜索决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序搜索方法通常依赖手工设计的搜索过程，缺乏端到端优化来学习最优搜索策略，导致搜索效率受限。

Method: 提出TimeSearch-R框架，将时序搜索重新定义为交错文本-视频思考，使用强化学习（特别是GRPO-CSV方法）来优化搜索策略，并通过完整性自验证机制改进视频推理的完整性。

Result: 在Haystack-LVBench、Haystack-Ego4D等时序搜索基准以及VideoMME、MLVU等长视频理解基准上取得显著提升，在LongVideoBench上相比基础模型Qwen2.5-VL提升4.1%，相比先进视频推理模型Video-R1提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过强化学习和完整性自验证机制有效提升了时序搜索和长视频理解的性能，建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了视觉空间调优（VST）框架，通过构建大规模数据集和渐进式训练方法，增强视觉语言模型的空间感知和推理能力，而不损害其通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升视觉语言模型的空间感知能力是实现类人通用智能的关键，但现有方法通常需要额外编码器且会损害通用能力。

Method: 构建VST-P（410万样本）和VST-R（13.5万样本）数据集，采用监督微调建立基础空间知识，然后通过强化学习提升空间推理能力。

Result: 在多个空间基准测试中取得最先进结果，包括MMSI-Bench 34.8%和VSIBench 61.2%。

Conclusion: 视觉-语言-动作模型可以通过空间调优范式显著增强，为更物理接地的人工智能铺平道路。

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

TL;DR: ScheduleStream是首个用于规划与调度的通用框架，专门解决双手机器人和类人机器人的并行运动规划问题，通过混合持续动作建模时间动态，实现多臂协同任务执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双手机器人和类人机器人具有类似人类的多臂协同能力，但多臂同时控制面临混合离散-连续动作空间增长的挑战。传统的任务与运动规划算法通常只规划单臂运动，无法实现多臂并行调度。

Method: 提出ScheduleStream框架，使用混合持续动作建模时间动态，支持异步启动和持续时间参数化。开发领域无关算法解决ScheduleStream问题，在任务与运动规划调度中利用GPU加速采样器加快规划速度。

Result: 与多个消融实验相比，ScheduleStream算法能产生更高效的解决方案。在多个真实世界双手机器人任务中进行了演示验证。

Conclusion: ScheduleStream成功扩展了任务与运动规划算法，使其能够生成支持并行臂运动的调度方案，为多臂机器人协同控制提供了有效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like
ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However,
controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the
growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning
(TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce
plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow
for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we
present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning &
scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics
using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist
for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose
domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any
application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion
Planning & Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers
to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations
in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We
demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at

Motivation: 传统机器人仿真构建过程劳动密集，限制了机器人学习的规模化发展。需要自动化方法来生成多样化、复杂的仿真环境以增强策略验证。

Method: 使用大语言模型扩展编码因果关系的定向图，生成结构化场景描述，然后转换为符号程序来配置和执行机器人仿真环境。

Conclusion: ReGen框架通过自动化仿真设计，增强了机器人策略的验证能力，支持数据和仿真增强，推动了可扩展的机器人学习以实现更好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating
policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This
paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates
simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a
motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description,
ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the
behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by
expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships,
relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then
translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot
simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based
on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation,
(iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning
with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We
demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks,
generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing
simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for
corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and
supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for
improved generalization and robustness. We provide code and example videos at:

*Zixuan Huang,Huaidian Hou,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态扩散强制（MDF）框架，通过随机部分掩码和扩散模型来学习多模态机器人轨迹，不仅生成动作，还能学习时间依赖性和跨模态关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准模仿学习方法通常只学习从观察到动作的直接映射，忽略了不同模态（感官输入、动作、奖励）之间的丰富交互关系，而这些关系对于建模机器人行为和理解任务结果至关重要。

Method: 提出MDF框架，应用随机部分掩码并训练扩散模型来重构轨迹，鼓励模型学习时间依赖性和跨模态依赖关系，如预测动作对力信号的影响或从部分观察推断状态。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境的接触丰富、强力操作任务中评估MDF，结果显示MDF不仅提供多功能性，还实现了强大的性能和噪声观察下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MDF框架能够有效学习多模态机器人轨迹中的复杂依赖关系，在接触丰富的操作任务中表现出色，具有多功能性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning
approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB
images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay
between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which
is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this
work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning
from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation.
Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking
and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training
objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies,
such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states
from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful
manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show
that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong
performance, and robustness under noisy observations. More visualizations can

Conclusion: Pixi通过提供可扩展、可重现的协作研究基础设施，加速了机器人和AI领域的进展。

Abstract: The reproducibility crisis in scientific computing constrains robotics
research. Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot
be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment
because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex.
These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software
toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified
package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact
dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit
reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up
to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of
the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers.
Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours
to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide. By enabling
scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure, Pixi accelerates
progress in robotics and AI.

Conclusion: 这是第一个为基于采样的运动规划器提供概率正确采样区域保证的非均匀采样方法，显著提高了规划效率和泛化性能。

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used to compute dynamically
feasible robot paths. However, their reliance on uniform sampling often leads
to poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments. We introduce a
novel non-uniform sampling strategy that integrates into existing SBMPs by
biasing sampling toward `certified' regions. These regions are constructed by
(i) generating an initial, possibly infeasible, path using any heuristic path
predictor (e.g., A* or vision-language models) and (ii) applying conformal
prediction to quantify the predictor's uncertainty. This process yields
prediction sets around the initial-guess path that are guaranteed, with
user-specified probability, to contain the optimal solution. To our knowledge,
this is the first non-uniform sampling approach for SBMPs that provides such
probabilistically correct guarantees on the sampling regions. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently finds feasible paths
faster and generalizes better to unseen environments than existing baselines.

Motivation: 太阳能系统在关键任务应用中（如太空探索、野火监测传感器系统）可能因灰尘覆盖或太空碎片撞击而受限甚至终止运行，需要开发有效的清洁和保护解决方案。

Method: 设计了两种清洁机制（雨刮系统和轨道系统）并进行比较测试；通过碰撞测试评估了防护材料，重点研究了聚碳酸酯和软硬材料分层结构。

Result: 防护材料测试显示聚碳酸酯具有良好前景，但最关键的因素是在面板表面和硬质材料之间添加软质材料层；清洁系统比较中，雨刮系统在成本、清洁速度和总功耗方面均优于轨道系统。

Conclusion: 雨刮清洁系统比轨道系统更高效，而防护材料的最佳配置是在太阳能电池板表面使用软硬材料分层结构，聚碳酸酯是值得考虑的防护材料选择。

Abstract: Solar energy is used for many mission-critical applications including space
exploration, sensor systems to monitor wildfires, etc. Their operation can be
limited or even terminated if solar panels are covered with dust or hit by
space debris. To address this issue, we designed panel cleaning mechanisms and
tested protective materials. For cleaning mechanisms, we designed and compared
a wiper system and a rail system. For protective materials, we found through
collision tests that polycarbonate was very promising, though the most
important factor was layering a soft material between the panel's surface and a
hard material. In the cleaning system comparisons, the wiper-based system was
more efficient than the rail-based system in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and
total power consumption.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used
to improve the domain of Embodied Intelligence. The central objective of
iFlyBot-VLM is to bridge the cross-modal semantic gap between high-dimensional
environmental perception and low-level robotic motion control. To this end, the
model abstracts complex visual and spatial information into a body-agnostic and
transferable Operational Language, thereby enabling seamless perception-action
closed-loop coordination across diverse robotic platforms. The architecture of
iFlyBot-VLM is systematically designed to realize four key functional
capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and
Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and
Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We
envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for
embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented
systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations
on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets,
such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while
preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the
training data and model weights to foster further research and development in
the field of Embodied Intelligence.

Abstract: This article presents a method for computing the largest singularity-free
sphere (SFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM) over a
specified orientation workspace. For a fixed orientation of the moving
platform, the SFS is computed analytically. This process is repeated over a set
of samples generated within the orientation workspace, and the smallest among
them is designated as the desired SFS for the given orientation workspace.
Numerical experiments are performed on four distinct architectures of the SGPM
to understand their relative performances w.r.t. SFS volumes over the same
orientation workspace. This study demonstrates the potential utility of the
proposed computational method both in analysis and design of SGPMs.

Method: 在视觉编码器和扩散模型之间插入混合专家层，将策略知识分解为专门处理不同任务阶段的专家，动态激活处理不同阶段。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful framework for robotic
visuomotor control, yet they often lack the robustness to recover from subtask
failures in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks and their learned representations
of observations are often difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose the
Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is
to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the
diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of
specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases
of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a
strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming
standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation
tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under
disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real
world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show
that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts
correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping). This
learned structure can be leveraged for inference-time control, allowing for the
rearrangement of subtasks without any re-training.Our video and code are

Motivation: 解决机器人在复杂约束空间中操作细长物体时，现有规划方法在低间隙场景下因采样困难或局部极小值而失败的问题。

Method: TAPOM方法结合高层拓扑分析识别关键路径并生成引导关键帧，然后利用低层规划器寻找可行的构型空间轨迹。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread
applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with
elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance
scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work
proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which
explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient
planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and
generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find
feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates
significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad
implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DAP的双演员策略，将物体操作任务明确分为接近阶段和操作阶段，分别使用不同的视觉先验来增强每个阶段的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用单一策略学习整个物体操作过程，忽略了任务分阶段的特点。为了解决这个问题，需要设计能够明确考虑不同阶段并利用异构视觉先验的方法。

Method: 提出DAP双演员策略：1）基于可供性的演员定位功能部件改善接近过程；2）基于运动流的演员捕捉部件运动促进操作过程；3）决策器确定当前阶段并选择对应演员。同时构建了包含7个任务的模拟数据集。

Result: 在自建数据集、RoboTwin基准测试和真实场景中，该方法平均分别比SOTA方法高出5.55%、14.7%和10.4%。

Conclusion: DAP通过明确分阶段设计和异构视觉先验的利用，在物体操作任务中取得了显著性能提升，特别是在长期多阶段任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Object manipulation, which focuses on learning to perform tasks on similar
parts across different types of objects, can be divided into an approaching
stage and a manipulation stage. However, previous works often ignore this
characteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the
whole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different
stages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage.
Specifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional
part in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process.
Following this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of
the component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a
decision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the
corresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain
few objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address
this, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation
Dataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks,
including two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks. Experimental results on
our dataset, the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world scenarios illustrate that
our method consistently outperforms the SOTA method by 5.55%, 14.7% and 10.4%
on average respectively.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous systems has experienced remarkable growth in
recent years, driven by their integration into sectors such as industry,
medicine, logistics, and domestic environments. This expansion is accompanied
by a series of security issues that entail significant risks due to the
critical nature of autonomous systems, especially those operating in
human-interaction environments. Furthermore, technological advancement and the
high operational and architectural complexity of autonomous systems have
resulted in an increased attack surface. This article presents a specific
security auditing procedure for autonomous systems, based on a layer-structured
methodology, a threat taxonomy adapted to the robotic context, and a set of
concrete mitigation measures. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through four practical case studies applied to representative
robotic platforms: the Vision 60 military quadruped from Ghost Robotics, the A1
robot from Unitree Robotics, the UR3 collaborative arm from Universal Robots,
and the Pepper social robot from Aldebaran Robotics.

Abstract: Robots operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable
challenges. Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn
manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks,
such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot
policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human
demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video
bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich
the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as
object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional
inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities.
We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an
external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification,
and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the
learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to
various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data.
Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our
system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional
robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of
robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种共生交互学习(SIL)方法，使人类和机器人能够通过双向互动共同适应，超越传统的主从模式，实现主动澄清、适应性建议和共享计划优化。


<details>

Motivation: 当前的人机交互方法延续了主从模式，机器人被动执行人类指令，缺乏人类日常互动中的共同适应动态。这种单向交互限制了人机协作的自然性和效率。

Method: 将SIL形式化为共享潜在任务空间中的共同适应过程，使用预训练基础模型进行空间感知和推理，结合轻量级潜在编码器将模型输出转换为任务特定表示，并采用记忆架构防止任务空间表示的遗忘。

Conclusion: SIL方法能够实现人类和机器人之间的双向共同适应，使机器人从被动执行转变为主动参与，提升了人机交互的自然性和协作效率。

Abstract: Today's autonomous agents can understand free-form natural language
instructions and execute long-horizon tasks in a manner akin to human-level
reasoning. These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained
foundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are
grounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice
model, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes
the master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive
interaction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in
everyday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a
Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and
the apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We
formalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,
where the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on
interaction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution
to proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.
To realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial
perception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds
the models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure
stability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that
prevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL
on both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction
following, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive
dialogues. Demos and resources are public

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大多数公开数据集专注于单臂演示，将视觉语言动作模型适应双臂任务通常需要大量额外的双臂数据和微调，这限制了数据效率和性能。

Method: 提出TwinVLA框架，将两个预训练的单臂VLA模型组合成一个协调的双臂VLA，采用模块化组合方法而非训练单一跨体现模型。

Result: 在真实世界和仿真环境的各种双臂任务中，TwinVLA优于同等规模的单体RDT-1B模型，且无需任何双臂预训练，显著缩小了与依赖大量专有双臂数据的最先进模型π0的差距。

Conclusion: 模块化组合方法为高性能双臂操作提供了一条数据高效且可扩展的路径，能够充分利用公开的单臂数据。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets
have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual
tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm
demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial
additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we
introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained
single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic
cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data,
TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained
single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation
settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model
without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to
state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual
data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach
as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual
manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate
environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle
detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that
manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work
introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e.
positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's
joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate
limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space
obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the
manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations
classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby
allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot
manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware
experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results
demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during
interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for
real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered
environments.

Conclusion: 通过整合关键安全和控制机制，ETHOS为虚拟环境中高保真、动态人际互动建立了实用基础。

Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction),
a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical
contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers,
fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic
manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a
baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a
safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We
introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary
prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD
baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by
exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand
tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests
show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions
achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21
ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the
feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating
essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical
foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual
environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an energy-conservation based control architecture
for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots. We model the robot as a
Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the
bouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological
quadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation
control during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice
inspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped
systems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the
quadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated
using the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the
design specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we
demonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.
Additionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its
ability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in
sensor measurements.

Motivation: 传统四旋翼采用刚性框架，虽然支持敏捷飞行但限制了碰撞韧性和可压缩性，无法在复杂环境中飞行。受生物飞行器软翼的启发，希望开发既能保持敏捷性又能提高环境适应性的软框架四旋翼。

Method: 采用软框架设计方法，使四旋翼框架具有高度柔顺性（比传统四旋翼柔顺三个数量级），同时通过优化结构柔软度范围（0.006-0.77 N/mm）来平衡敏捷性、可压缩性和碰撞韧性。

Result: 405克原型机实现了超过80 km/h的峰值速度，线性和角加速度分别超过3g和300 rad/s²，碰撞韧性提高4倍，可承受5 m/s正面碰撞，可压缩至标称宽度的70%通过狭窄间隙。

Conclusion: FlexiQuad扩展了悬停无人机在复杂环境中的能力，实现了在不牺牲飞行性能的情况下进行鲁棒的物理交互，其结构柔软度范围与自然飞行器的翅膀相当。

Abstract: Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight
behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways,
and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely
on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision
resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in
cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed
mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce
FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.
We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more
compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres
with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3
g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate
accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.
Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,
surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising
forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,
enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our
analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77
N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,
squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad
models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in
complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without
compromising flight performance.
