### [1] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI是一个开源视频标注工具，专门用于在动物行为研究中标注行为和互动，填补了现有工具无法同时支持行为标注和个体定位的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注工具要么只支持行为标注而不定位个体，要么只定位个体而无法捕捉互动，这限制了计算机视觉方法在动物行为分析中的应用。

Method: 开发了SILVI软件，整合了行为标注和个体定位功能，允许研究人员直接在视频数据中标注行为和互动，生成适合训练计算机视觉模型的结构化输出。

Result: SILVI成功连接了行为生态学和计算机视觉，为细粒度行为分析自动化方法的发展提供了支持。

Conclusion: SILVI填补了动物行为研究中互动标注工具的空白，虽然主要针对动物行为开发，但也可广泛应用于需要提取动态场景图的人类互动标注。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [2] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究通过噪声注入技术提高COVID-19胸部X光检测模型的分布外泛化能力，将ID和OOD性能差距从0.10-0.20降低到0.01-0.06。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在图像识别中容易学习源特定伪影而非合理生物标志物，导致在分布外数据上泛化失败，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中。

Method: 在训练过程中使用基础噪声注入技术（高斯、散斑、泊松和椒盐噪声）来提高模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，噪声注入技术显著减少了ID和OOD评估之间的性能差距，在AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标上，平均差距从0.10-0.20降至0.01-0.06。

Conclusion: 噪声注入是一种有效提高COVID-19胸部X光检测模型分布外泛化能力的方法。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [3] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索了基于模仿学习的机器人控制策略在X射线引导脊柱手术中的应用，开发了高真实度的模拟环境，训练了仅基于视觉信息的插管对齐策略，在模拟和真实X射线图像上都取得了有前景的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模仿学习在X射线引导脊柱手术中的适用性，因为多视图X射线解释复杂，传统方法面临挑战。

Method: 开发高真实度的X射线引导脊柱手术模拟沙盒，收集正确轨迹和对应双平面X射线序列数据集，训练基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略进行规划和开环控制。

Result: 策略在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，能够保持安全的椎弓根内轨迹，对复杂解剖（包括骨折）具有泛化能力，在真实X射线图像上也能产生合理轨迹。

Conclusion: 虽然初步结果有前景，但在入口点精度方面存在局限，完全闭环控制需要更频繁的反馈机制，结合更强的先验知识和领域知识，这类模型可能为无CT的机器人脊柱导航奠定基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [4] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv12的轻量级实时目标检测框架，结合自对抗训练和专门数据增强策略，用于沙漠环境中的垃圾检测，在精度和效率方面取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球垃圾危机日益严重，传统垃圾收集方法在偏远或恶劣环境（如沙漠）中效率低下且危险。现有计算机视觉研究主要关注城市环境和可回收材料，忽视了有机和危险垃圾以及沙漠等未充分探索的地形。

Method: 使用修剪后的轻量级YOLOv12版本，集成自对抗训练（SAT）和专门的数据增强策略，在DroneTrashNet数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: 在精度、召回率和平均精度（mAP）方面取得显著改进，同时实现低延迟和紧凑的模型大小，适合在资源受限的无人机上部署。与最先进的轻量级YOLO变体相比，在准确性和效率方面达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结合数据中心和模型中心增强方法，为沙漠环境中的鲁棒实时垃圾检测提供了有效解决方案，验证了该方法在资源受限设备上的部署可行性。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [5] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于类别的图像合成方法，通过将同一类别的多张图像融合成复合图像来增强训练数据，有效解决了小样本、不平衡数据集和图像质量差导致的深度学习模型误判率高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本、不平衡数据集和输入图像质量差导致的深度学习模型高误判率问题，特别是在医学影像诊断领域。

Method: 提出类基图像合成方法，将同一类别的多张图像融合成复合输入图像，增强类内方差，提高每个训练样本的信息密度。

Result: 在OCTDL数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了诊断性能，准确率达到99.6%，F1分数0.995，AUC 0.9996，误判率显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为受类别不平衡或小样本影响的弱数据集产生高质量预测，证明了图像合成在改善深度学习模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [6] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出边界距离回归(BDR)和自适应时间细化(ATR)两个互补方法，通过优化边界检测的计算分配，显著提升时序动作定位性能。BDR使用有符号距离回归替代分类，ATR通过连续深度选择实现自适应计算分配，在多个基准测试上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序动作定位方法对所有边界采用统一计算，但不同边界的检测难度存在显著差异，这导致计算资源分配不合理。

Method: 1. 边界距离回归(BDR)：使用有符号距离回归替代分类，提供信息理论最优的定位；2. 自适应时间细化(ATR)：通过连续深度选择τ∈[0,1]分配计算，实现端到端可微分优化。

Result: BDR使边界峰值锐度提升43%，在现有方法上仅需约50行代码即可实现1.8-3.1%的mAP@0.7改进。ATR在THUMOS14上达到56.5% mAP@0.7，计算量162G FLOPs，相比统一处理的53.6% mAP@0.7和198G FLOPs，性能提升2.9%同时计算量减少18%。在短动作上改进达4.2%。

Conclusion: 通过自适应计算分配和边界距离回归，可以显著提升时序动作定位性能，同时降低计算成本。知识蒸馏可缓解训练成本，轻量级学生模型在基准成本下保持99%性能。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [7] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一处理几何和外观优化的框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常优先考虑几何精度或逼真渲染，将几何和外观优化解耦，这阻碍了下游编辑任务。本文主张对几何和外观优化进行统一处理，实现无缝的高斯-网格联合优化。

Method: 提出新颖框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，利用输入图像的光度一致性和法线、深度图的几何正则化。

Result: 获得高质量的3D重建结果，可在下游编辑任务中进一步利用，如重新照明和形状变形。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了几何和外观的联合优化，为3D编辑、AR/VR和数字内容创建等应用提供了高质量的3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于线性分数变换参数α的光场相机标定方法，通过解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，实现了快速准确的内部参数标定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场相机内部参数的精确标定是3D重建的关键前提，但现有方法面临挑战。本文旨在解决主镜头和微透镜阵列的解耦标定问题。

Method: 提出线性分数变换参数α来解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，采用基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，并介绍了原始图像特征检测方法。

Result: 在物理和模拟数据上的实验验证了所提方法的性能，基于该模型的原始光场图像模拟速度更快，有利于数据驱动的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为光场相机标定提供了有效的解决方案，代码可从作者网站获取。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [9] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为Room Envelopes的合成数据集，用于训练单目几何估计器预测场景的可见表面和结构布局表面，从而理解场景范围和物体形状位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，导致重建不完整。场景的结构元素（如墙壁、地板、天花板）相对容易预测，因为它们通常是平面、重复且简单的，因此需要更经济的方法。

Method: 创建合成数据集Room Envelopes，提供RGB图像和两个关联的点图：一个捕捉可见表面，另一个捕捉移除家具和固定装置后的结构布局表面。这为前馈单目几何估计器提供直接监督。

Result: 该方法能够同时预测第一可见表面和第一布局表面，从而理解场景的完整范围和物体的形状位置。

Conclusion: 通过Room Envelopes数据集，可以实现对场景结构元素的准确预测，为场景理解提供更完整的信息。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [10] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究发现人类通过3D姿态信息进行社交互动判断，而当前AI视觉模型缺乏这种能力。通过提取3D关节位置和面部方向等简单空间特征，可以显著提升AI模型的社交判断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何从视觉输入中快速提取社交互动信息，以及为什么先进的AI视觉系统在这方面仍然面临挑战。

Method: 结合最先进的姿态和深度估计算法，提取视频中人物的3D关节位置，并与AI视觉模型进行比较。还开发了一套紧凑的3D社交姿态特征描述符。

Result: 3D关节位置在预测人类社交判断方面优于大多数AI视觉模型。简单的3D社交姿态特征与完整关节集具有相同的预测能力，并能显著提升现成AI模型的性能。

Conclusion: 人类社交场景理解依赖于明确的3D姿态表征，可以通过简单的结构化视觉空间基元来支持。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [11] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF是一个完全可微的框架，直接在3D高斯空间中操作，通过引入高斯场相机编码和训练配对视图监督，解决了多视图一致性问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视图特定特征学习，导致跨视图一致性不足，需要开发直接在3D高斯空间中操作并能实现多视图一致性的框架。

Method: 提出高斯场相机编码(GFCE)将相机几何融入高斯文本交互，建模视图依赖变化；引入训练配对视图监督(ITPVS)在训练期间对齐校准视图的高斯对数，缓解单视图过拟合。

Result: 在Ref LERF、LERF OVS和3D OVS数据集上分别实现16.8%、4.3%和2.0%的mIoU平均提升，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CaRF框架实现了更可靠和视图一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在益处。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

### [12] [PhysCorr: Dual-Reward DPO for Physics-Constrained Text-to-Video Generation with Automated Preference Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03997)
*Peiyao Wang,Weining Wang,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr是一个统一的框架，用于建模、评估和优化视频生成中的物理一致性，通过PhysicsRM奖励模型和PhyDPO优化方法显著提升生成视频的物理真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型虽然在感知质量上取得了显著进展，但生成的视频内容经常违反物理合理性原则，表现为不合理的物体动态、不连贯的交互和不真实的运动模式，这阻碍了在具身AI、机器人和模拟密集型领域的应用。

Method: 提出了PhysCorr框架，包括：1) PhysicsRM - 首个双维度奖励模型，量化物体内部稳定性和物体间交互；2) PhyDPO - 基于对比反馈和物理感知重加权的直接偏好优化流程。该方法是模型无关且可扩展的。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PhysCorr在保持视觉保真度和语义对齐的同时，显著提高了物理真实性。

Conclusion: 这项工作向物理基础和可信赖的视频生成迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring是一种稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，就能实现近乎无损的几何保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于等值面的体素化表示方法严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，这会不可避免地损害几何保真度。

Method: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示，设计双模式自编码器实现可扩展且保持细节的形状重建。

Result: 直接表示达到10^-5级别的距离误差；网格重建相比强基线，Chamfer距离减少93%，F-score提高35%。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring在表示和重建的准确性和效率方面均超越现有方法，作为3D学习任务的表示具有卓越保真度。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

TL;DR: Bratrix是一个端到端的多模态语言锚定视觉-大脑对齐框架，通过将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，并将视觉和大脑表征投影到共享潜在空间，实现视觉-语言和大脑-语言嵌入的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将神经活动直接与视觉嵌入对齐，但纯视觉表示往往无法捕捉潜在语义维度，限制了可解释性和深度鲁棒性。需要解决主体变异性和视觉特征纠缠的挑战。

Method: Bratrix将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，使用可学习的语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态相关性，采用两阶段训练策略（单模态预训练后多模态微调），并包含不确定性感知模块来处理噪声神经信号。

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和字幕生成方面优于现有方法，特别是在200-way EEG检索任务中提升了14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过语言锚定的多模态对齐方法，有效解决了从神经信号中揭示视觉语义的挑战，提高了对齐精度和性能。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

TL;DR: SpatialLock是一个新颖的文本到图像生成框架，通过感知信号和定位信息联合控制空间位置生成，解决了现有方法在对象定位精度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致对对象空间布局理解不足，难以实现精确的对象定位控制。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含两个组件：位置参与注入(PoI)通过注意力层直接整合空间信息；位置引导学习(PoG)使用感知监督进一步优化对象定位。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在精确对象定位方面达到新的最先进水平，在多个数据集上IOU得分超过0.9。

Conclusion: SpatialLock能够生成具有精确空间排列的对象，并提高生成图像的视觉质量，为文本到图像合成中的对象定位控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG是一种无需训练的策略，通过将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，显著加速扩散采样同时保持高保真度生成。该方法将噪声估计和额外引导项分别在不同时间步网格上积分，减少30%函数评估次数，性能优于现有CFG加速器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散求解器未能充分利用额外引导项对数值误差的鲁棒性，存在计算冗余。通过分析误差边界，发现额外引导分支对近似更具容忍度，为加速采样提供了理论依据。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在细粒度时间步网格上积分（乌龟方程），额外引导仅在粗网格上积分（野兔方程）。引入误差边界感知时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: THG将函数评估次数减少高达30%，生成保真度几乎无损失（ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032），在相同计算预算下优于现有CFG加速器。

Conclusion: 多速率公式为扩散求解器提供了新潜力，为实现无需模型重训练的实时高质量图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图生成方法主要关注通用合成，缺乏对草图风格的精确控制机制，需要开发能够通过文本和参考草图进行显式风格指导的方法。

Method: 基于扩散模型，将参考特征作为辅助信息结合线性平滑，采用风格-内容指导机制，避免传统自注意力中键值矩阵覆盖的问题，并通过联合AdaIN模块支持多风格生成。

Conclusion: M3S框架有效解决了草图风格控制问题，通过创新的风格-内容指导机制减少了内容泄漏，提升了合成质量，为可控多风格草图生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available
at https://github.com/CMACH508/M3S.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low?cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded

Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档理解中，扫描或拍摄文档的正确方向确定是一个关键的预处理步骤。准确的旋转校正对于提升OCR等下游任务的性能至关重要，因为用户在拍摄过程中经常会出现方向错误。

Method: 首先引入ORB基准测试，包括英文OCR数据集构建的ORB-En和涵盖11种印度语言的新多语言数据集ORB-Indic。然后基于Phi-3.5-Vision模型的视觉编码器构建快速、鲁棒且轻量级的旋转分类管道，采用动态图像裁剪技术，专门针对4类旋转任务进行微调。

Conclusion: 提出的旋转分类模块在文档方向校正方面表现出色，不仅准确率高，而且能显著提升OCR系统的整体性能，特别是在处理多语言和低资源语言文档时具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了不同颜色变换技术对H&E染色图像与非线性多模态图像配准的影响，发现CycleGAN颜色变换在两种场景下均获得最低配准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准不同模态的图像对于生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用至关重要，需要研究颜色变换技术如何影响图像配准性能。

Method: 使用20对组织样本，应用多种预处理步骤（CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane颜色变换、反转、对比度调整、强度归一化和去噪），采用VALIS配准方法进行刚性和非刚性配准，使用相对目标配准误差(rTRE)评估性能。

Result: 在所有测试方法中，CycleGAN颜色变换在两个场景（原始和反转多模态图像）中都实现了最低的配准误差，其他方法显示出更高的误差。

Conclusion: 在配准前应用颜色变换可以改善不同模态图像之间的对齐效果，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的图像风格迁移方法在运动数据上效果有限，因为运动具有复杂的动态模式和时空一致性特征，需要更全面的统计建模。

Method: 提出了自适应统计融合器(AStF)，包含风格解耦模块(SDM)和高阶多统计注意力机制(HOS-Attn)，并结合运动一致性正则化(MCR)判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，AStF在运动风格迁移任务上表现出色，超越了现有最先进方法，能够更全面地建模动态风格的时空统计模式。

Conclusion: 通过引入偏度和峰度等更高阶统计量，AStF能够更好地捕捉运动数据的复杂动态特性，为运动风格迁移提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于DINOv2的步态表征学习框架(DinoGRL)，用于解决视频可见光-红外行人重识别(VVI-ReID)问题，通过结合步态特征和外观线索来增强跨模态检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模态不变的外观特征，但忽略了步态特征——这种特征不仅模态不变，还富含时间动态信息。这限制了它们对跨模态视频匹配所需时空一致性的建模能力。

Method: 提出了DinoGRL框架，包含语义感知轮廓和步态学习(SASGL)模型，利用DINOv2的通用语义先验生成和增强轮廓表示，并与ReID目标联合优化；还开发了渐进双向多粒度增强(PBMGE)模块，通过步态和外观流之间的双向交互逐步优化特征表示。

Result: 在HITSZ-VCM和BUPT数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合DINOv2的视觉先验和步态特征学习，提出的框架能够生成语义丰富且任务自适应的步态特征，有效提升了跨模态行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FastGS是一个新颖的3D高斯溅射加速框架，通过基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，在保持渲染质量的同时显著提升训练速度，在多个数据集上实现3.32-15.45倍的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射加速方法无法有效控制训练过程中的高斯数量，导致冗余计算时间开销。

Method: 提出基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，摒弃预算机制，充分考虑每个高斯的的重要性。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上相比DashGaussian实现3.32倍训练加速，在Deep Blending数据集上相比原始3DGS实现15.45倍加速，渲染质量相当。

Conclusion: FastGS具有强泛化性，在动态场景重建、表面重建、稀疏视图重建、大规模重建和SLAM等任务中均能提供2-7倍的训练加速。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 该研究将通用视觉基础模型适配到除草剂试验领域，通过自监督学习在农业数据集上训练，显著提升了物种识别和损伤分类性能，特别是在未见条件下的表现更优，同时大幅减少了标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 除草剂田间试验需要准确识别植物物种和评估除草剂引起的损伤，但通用视觉基础模型在农业领域的细粒度区分方面表现有限。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法在大型农业数据集上训练领域特定的基础模型，学习针对除草剂试验图像的丰富可迁移表示。

Result: 领域特定模型在物种识别（F1从0.91提升到0.94）和损伤分类（从0.26到0.33）上显著优于通用模型，在未见条件下提升更大（物种识别从0.56到0.66；损伤分类从0.17到0.27），在无人机图像等域迁移场景中保持强性能。

Conclusion: 领域特定的基础模型具有强大的泛化能力，能显著减少人工标注工作量，为除草剂试验分析提供可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上基础设施扩张需要有效监测系统，但现有模型在样本稀缺特别是代表性不足的类别上表现不佳，需要解决数据集不平衡问题。

Method: 结合合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星图像训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，在里海、南海、几内亚湾和巴西海岸四个区域训练，在墨西哥湾、北海和波斯湾三个未见区域测试。

Result: 共检测到3,529个海上平台，F1分数从0.85提升到0.90，合成数据改善了类别不平衡问题并提升了整体性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据生成是解决遥感常见挑战的有效策略，展示了深度学习在全球可扩展海上基础设施监测方面的潜力。

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: RISE-T2V是一个创新的文本到视频生成框架，通过集成提示重述和语义特征提取，解决了现有模型在简短提示下视频质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器进行语义对齐，但在简洁提示下往往无法保持视频质量，且无法在线重述提示以更好地匹配用户意图，限制了模型的可扩展性和可用性。

Method: 提出RISE-T2V框架，集成提示重述和语义特征提取为一个步骤，创新性地引入重述适配器模块，利用LLM在下一个令牌预测时的文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件。

Result: 实验证明RISE-T2V是一个通用框架，适用于不同的视频扩散模型架构，显著提升了文本到视频模型生成高质量、符合用户意图视频的能力。

Conclusion: RISE-T2V通过将提示重述和语义特征提取集成到单一流程中，有效解决了现有文本到视频模型在语义理解和用户意图匹配方面的局限性，提升了模型的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了传感器遮挡对基于BEV融合的3D物体检测性能的影响，发现在nuScenes数据集上，相机遮挡导致mAP下降41.3%，而LiDAR仅在重度遮挡时性能下降47.3%。融合设置中，LiDAR遮挡的影响比相机遮挡更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然BEV融合架构通过多模态集成展示了强大性能，但环境条件（如雾、霾或物理障碍）引起的传感器遮挡对3D检测精度的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和LiDAR遮挡对3D检测性能的影响，使用mAP和NDS作为性能指标。

Result: 仅相机检测时，中度遮挡导致mAP从35.6%降至20.9%（下降41.3%）；LiDAR仅在重度遮挡时mAP从64.7%降至34.1%（下降47.3%）。融合设置中，相机遮挡仅导致4.1%下降，而LiDAR遮挡导致26.8%下降。

Conclusion: 模型在3D物体检测任务中更依赖LiDAR，需要未来研究开发遮挡感知评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术，以在部分传感器失效或环境条件恶化时保持检测精度。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 本教程填补了分析化学中深度学习应用的指导空白，使研究人员能够利用现有开源模型高效提取成像数据的空间信息。

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

system integrates three curated datasets: (1) Kvasir-VQA-x1 for question-answer
learning, (2) a synthetically enriched explanation dataset offering structured
medical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with
segmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn
visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are
both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HideAndSeg，一种基于AI的弱监督工具，用于在自然环境中自动分割章鱼视频，结合SAM2和YOLOv11，通过无监督指标评估分割质量，解决了章鱼伪装、变形和遮挡等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于章鱼在自然环境中的伪装能力、皮肤纹理颜色快速变化、非刚性身体变形和频繁遮挡，加上水下光照和浑浊度变化，分析章鱼行为极具挑战性。现有缺乏大规模标注数据集的问题需要解决。

Method: HideAndSeg整合SAM2与定制训练的YOLOv11目标检测器。首先用户提供点坐标生成初始分割掩码，这些掩码作为YOLO模型的训练数据。然后通过边界框提示完全自动化流程，无需进一步人工干预。引入两个无监督指标：时间一致性DICE_t和新组件计数NC_t。

Result: HideAndSeg实现了令人满意的性能，相比手动提示方法减少了分割噪声。该方法能够在自然环境中完全遮挡后重新识别和分割章鱼，而手动提示模型在此场景下会失败。

Conclusion: 通过减少真实场景中手动分析的需求，这项工作提供了一个实用工具，为更高效的野生头足类动物行为研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了计算拼图求解器的应用范围，为凸多边形拼图提供了有效的解决方案和评估基准。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在跨传感器、跨区域和训练数据有限条件下进行滑坡测绘时存在困难，需要更稳健和可扩展的方法来减少滑坡风险。

Method: 采用基于全局预训练、自监督和可适应微调的地理空间基础模型Prithvi-EO-2.0，通过传感器、标签和领域三个维度进行分析框架设计。

Result: 该模型在多个实验中持续优于任务特定的CNN（U-Net、U-Net++）、视觉变换器（Segformer、SwinV2-B）和其他GeoFMs（TerraMind、SatMAE），对光谱变化具有韧性，在标签稀缺时保持准确性，并在不同数据集和地理环境中具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 地理空间基础模型为滑坡风险减少和环境监测提供了更稳健和可扩展的方法，但仍面临计算成本和可重用AI训练数据有限等挑战。

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了从完整LC视频进行基于PGS的自动手术复杂度评估的可扩展且有效的方法，有望用于术后分析和手术培训。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

TL;DR: UniSplat是一个用于自动驾驶的前馈3D重建框架，通过统一潜在时空融合解决稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态时存在困难，需要一种能够同时应对这些挑战的鲁棒动态场景重建方法。

Method: 构建3D潜在支架，利用预训练基础模型捕捉几何和语义场景上下文；引入高效融合机制在3D支架内直接操作，实现一致的时空对齐；设计双分支解码器，通过点锚定细化和基于体素的生成相结合，从融合支架生成动态感知高斯，并维护静态高斯的持久内存以实现流式场景补全。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，UniSplat在新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，即使在原始相机覆盖范围之外的视点也能提供鲁棒和高质量的渲染。

Conclusion: UniSplat通过统一潜在时空融合框架，成功解决了自动驾驶中动态场景重建的关键挑战，实现了超越现有相机覆盖范围的完整场景重建。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖框架，通过同时处理视觉提示输入和长文本描述来增强CLIP模型的细粒度图像-文本对齐能力，在像素级交互和长文本处理方面取得突破性进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注增强视觉信息处理的粒度，但CLIP文本编码器的固有令牌长度限制阻碍了处理长文本中嵌入的细粒度文本信息。需要协同利用视觉和文本内容处理粒度的优势。

Method: 1) 建立自动标注流水线生成像素级定位的长文本描述；2) 构建包含近150万样本的LongGRIT数据集；3) 用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器；4) 提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，实现任意粒度的图像区域与文本描述对齐。

Result: 实验证明PixCLIP在像素级交互和长文本处理方面展示突破，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同增强视觉和文本内容处理粒度，有效解决了CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的限制，为像素级视觉语言理解任务提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化评估虚拟免疫组化染色图像质量的框架，通过颜色反卷积生成IHC阳性像素掩码，直接量化染色准确性，发现传统图像保真度指标与病理学家评估相关性差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型可以从H&E图像生成虚拟IHC染色，但现有纹理和分布指标只能评估图像保真度，无法准确评估IHC染色的准确性，需要开发更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用颜色反卷积生成虚拟IHC模型预测的IHC阳性像素掩码，通过计算真实与虚拟IHC分割掩码的Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离等指标来直接量化像素级标记准确性。

Result: 传统图像保真度指标（FID、PSNR、SSIM）与染色准确性和病理学家评估相关性差；配对的PyramidPix2Pix和AdaptiveNCE模型染色准确性最高，非配对扩散和GAN模型可靠性较低；全玻片图像评估显示补丁级评估无法发现的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估虚拟IHC模型质量提供了可重复的方法，是加速病理学家常规使用的关键步骤，强调需要全玻片级别的基准测试。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，无需参考视频且不依赖人工标注，通过时间感知卷积架构从退化视频直接预测全参考指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在局限性：全参考方法需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考模型依赖昂贵的人工标注，而大多数无意见方法基于图像，忽略了视频检测中关键的时间上下文。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时间感知卷积架构直接从退化视频预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法优于图像基线，能泛化到多种退化类型，与全参考指标的相关性高于广泛使用的BRISQUE基线。

Conclusion: 时间建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，提出的时间感知、无意见方法有效且实用。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种诊断和去偏多模态基准测试的方法，通过测试集压力测试和迭代偏置剪枝来识别和减少非视觉偏置，确保基准测试真正评估视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型基准测试存在严重问题，模型可以通过利用偏置、语言先验和表面模式来获得高分，而无需真正的视觉理解能力，这削弱了基准测试的有效性。

Method: 采用测试集压力测试方法，通过仅使用测试集的非视觉文本输入对大型语言模型进行k折交叉验证微调，揭示捷径性能；同时使用基于随机森林的轻量级诊断工具进行快速审计；通过迭代偏置剪枝程序过滤高偏置样本。

Result: 在四个基准测试（VSI-Bench、CV-Bench、MMMU和VideoMME）中发现了普遍的非视觉偏置，并通过完整框架创建了VSI-Bench-Debiased，显著降低了非视觉可解性，扩大了视觉盲性能差距。

Conclusion: 基准测试设计应采用诊断原则，主动识别和缓解非视觉偏置，确保评估的是真正的视觉理解能力而非表面模式匹配。

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Motivation: 多模态语言模型在时空空间推理方面存在困难，而获取具有精确空间标注的多样化真实世界视频数据存在瓶颈，因此需要利用3D模拟器的特权信息来生成空间丰富的训练数据。

Method: 提出SIMS-V框架，利用3D模拟器生成空间丰富的视频训练数据，通过系统消融研究不同问题类型、混合方式和规模对真实世界迁移效果的影响。

Result: 识别出三种最有效的问题类别，仅用25K模拟示例训练的7B参数模型在真实世界空间推理基准上超越72B基线，并与专有模型性能相当，同时保持通用视频理解能力。

Conclusion: 模拟数据可以高效开发可迁移的空间智能，少量精心设计的训练数据就能实现强大的真实世界空间推理能力，同时保持模型的通用性。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出从反应式任务驱动系统转向空间超感知范式，开发了VSI-SUPER基准测试，证明仅靠数据扩展不足以实现空间超感知，需要预测性感知方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态智能主要关注反应式任务驱动系统，缺乏对空间认知和世界建模的深入探索，需要转向更全面的超感知范式。

Method: 提出空间超感知的四个阶段框架，开发VSI-SUPER基准测试（包含VSR和VSC任务），训练Cambrian-S模型，并引入基于预测误差的自监督下一潜在帧预测器。

Result: 通过VSI-590K数据扩展，在VSI-Bench上获得+30%绝对提升，但VSI-SUPER表现仍有限；预测性感知方法显著优于领先的专有基线。

Conclusion: 空间超感知需要模型不仅能感知，还要能预测、选择和组织经验，预测性感知是实现真正多模态智能的关键路径。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Motivation: 基于自回归建模在视觉和语言领域的成功，作者希望开发一个统一的框架来处理图像和视频生成任务，克服传统方法在处理时空依赖关系时的局限性。

Method: 采用纯离散的自回归方法，在单一架构中联合建模空间和时间依赖关系。通过直接的时间自回归支持多种生成任务，无需额外优化即可实现高效生成。

Result: 在VBench上获得83.74分，大幅超越所有自回归模型，甚至超过一些扩散模型如HunyuanVideo。生成5秒720p视频的速度比领先的基于扩散的方法快约10倍。

Conclusion: InfinityStar是第一个能够生成工业级720p视频的离散自回归视频生成器，展示了在高效高质量视频生成方面的突破性进展。

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

Motivation: 现实世界中的物体经常经历状态转换，现有方法在物体外观发生显著变化时往往会丢失跟踪目标，因此需要解决这一限制。

Method: TubeletGraph系统首先识别可能被忽略的轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合这些轨迹，然后对添加的轨迹进行推理并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Result: TubeletGraph在状态转换下实现了最先进的跟踪性能，同时展示了对物体转换的深入理解以及在复杂物体转换的时间定位和语义推理方面的有前景能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了物体状态转换跟踪问题，提供了更深入的物体动态理解，并发布了VOST-TAS基准数据集用于进一步研究。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文比较了三种数据驱动模型降阶技术（ERA、DMDc、LOpInf）在鳗鱼仿生软体机器人动态形状控制中的效果，发现LOpInf方法在所有实验中都能产生最低的跟踪误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软体机器人在需要动态控制整个身体的场景中展现出巨大潜力，但缺乏适用于控制的通用建模工具，特别是需要处理高维动力学的控制器。

Method: 使用三种数据驱动模型降阶技术（特征系统实现算法、带控制的动态模态分解、拉格朗日算子推断方法）生成适用于动态形状控制的线性模型，并在模拟的鳗鱼仿生软体机器人上进行模型预测控制策略测试。

Result: 在所有三个实验中（跟踪保证可行的模拟参考轨迹、跟踪基于生物模型生成的参考轨迹、跟踪物理模拟生成的参考轨迹），基于LOpInf的控制策略产生的跟踪误差均低于其他模型。

Conclusion: LOpInf方法在软体机器人动态形状控制中表现最优，为软体机器人的高维动力学控制提供了有效的模型降阶解决方案。

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in
delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while
real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this
work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables
humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct
integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends
Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic
environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control.
We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception
system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to
recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active
coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller
demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust
soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

*Kailun Ji,Xiaoyu Hu,Xinyu Zhang,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大语言模型(LLM)的LLM-CRF系统，用于改善无人机群在灾难搜救任务中的人机协作，通过自然交互方式理解操作员意图并自动规划任务，显著提升了任务效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模灾难搜救行动面临复杂地形和通信中断的挑战，无人机群虽然能提供广域搜索和物资投送等解决方案，但其有效协调给人类操作员带来了巨大的认知负担。核心的人机协作瓶颈在于"意图到行动的差距"，即在高压环境下将高层救援目标转化为低层群控命令的易出错过程。

Method: 提出LLM-CRF系统，利用大语言模型建模和增强人-群组队认知。框架通过语音或图形标注等自然多模态交互捕获操作员意图，使用LLM作为认知引擎执行意图理解、分层任务分解和无人机群任务规划。该闭环框架使群组能够作为主动伙伴提供实时反馈。

Result: 在模拟搜救场景中的实验结果显示，与传统基于命令的接口相比，所提出的LLM驱动方法将任务完成时间减少了约64.2%，任务成功率提高了7%。主观认知工作量显著降低，NASA-TLX得分下降了42.9%。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了LLM在高风险场景中创建更直观有效的人-群协作的潜力，通过减少手动监控和控制需求，显著提升了搜救任务的效能。

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文评估了下一代多核处理器在行星探索任务中的GNC和LVS算法部署，展示了显著性能提升，并提出了ARBITER故障检测机制确保计算可靠性。

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant
computing to enable autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and
Lander Vision System (LVS) operations during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).
This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x
speedup for Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Divert (GFOLD) trajectory
optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for
Trusted Execution and Recovery), a Multi-Core Voting (MV) mechanism that
performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient
architecture for future missions, including Mars Sample Return, Enceladus
Orbilander, and Ceres Sample Return, where onboard autonomy, low latency, and
fault resilience are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么仅部署在模拟人形角色上，要么专门针对特定任务如跟踪。需要开发一个能在真实世界人形机器人上执行多种任务的通用策略。

Method: 基于无监督强化学习和前向-后向模型，学习嵌入运动、目标和奖励的共享潜在表示，结合关键奖励塑造、领域随机化和历史依赖非对称学习来弥合模拟到现实的差距。

Result: BFM-Zero在真实世界的Unitree G1人形机器人上实现了多功能和鲁棒的全身体技能，支持零样本运动跟踪、目标到达和奖励优化，以及少样本优化适应。

Conclusion: BFM-Zero是首个此类模型，为可扩展、可提示的全身体人形控制行为基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Building Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) for humanoid robots has the
potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

<details>

Motivation: 现有Active SLAM方法存在探索速度慢和路径次优的问题，需要一种能够同时优化路径距离和地图不确定性的解决方案。

Method: 采用路径-不确定性协同优化深度强化学习框架，通过双目标奖励函数平衡探索与利用；结合轻量级停滞检测机制，包括激光雷达静态异常检测和地图更新停滞检测，减少冗余探索。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了Active SLAM的探索效率问题，消融研究证实协作机制加速训练收敛，物理机器人平台验证了算法从仿真到现实环境的成功迁移性。

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
environments.

TL;DR: GraspView是一个仅使用RGB相机的机器人抓取系统，通过全局感知场景重建、主动感知策略和在线度量对齐模块，在杂乱环境中实现精确抓取，显著优于RGB-D和单视图RGB基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人抓取系统依赖RGB-D相机提供几何信息，但在透明或光泽物体上会失效，且在近距离感知时性能下降。需要开发仅使用RGB相机的可靠抓取方案来解决这些问题。

Method: 集成三个关键组件：全局感知场景重建（从单RGB视图提供局部一致几何）、渲染评分主动感知策略（动态选择最佳视角揭示遮挡区域）、在线度量对齐模块（校准VGGT预测与机器人运动学）。

Result: 在多样化桌面物体上的实验表明，GraspView显著优于RGB-D和单视图RGB基线方法，特别是在严重遮挡、近场感知和透明物体情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: GraspView是RGB-D管道的实用且多功能替代方案，能够在非结构化真实世界环境中实现可靠抓取。

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究在机器人强化学习中通过条件化策略于动态参数估计（上下文）来改进模拟到真实环境的迁移性能，在标准控制基准和真实机器人推任务中验证了上下文感知策略优于上下文无关基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟到真实环境的迁移是机器人强化学习的主要挑战，由于环境动态差异，在模拟中训练的策略往往无法泛化到真实世界。虽然领域随机化通过暴露策略于随机化动态来缓解此问题，但会导致性能下降。

Method: 将上下文估计模块集成到基于领域随机化的强化学习框架中，并系统比较最先进的监督策略，在标准控制基准和真实机器人推任务中评估上下文感知策略。

Result: 结果显示上下文感知策略在所有设置中都优于上下文无关基线，但最佳监督策略取决于具体任务。

Conclusion: 通过条件化策略于动态参数估计可以显著改进模拟到真实环境的迁移性能，上下文感知方法在机器人强化学习中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

Motivation: 传统尾座式无人机在多旋翼模式下因暴露大迎风面积而容易受到风扰，需要解决这一问题以提高飞行稳定性。

Method: 设计了可重构机翼（多旋翼模式收缩、固定翼模式展开）、同轴异构双旋翼配置以提高能效，以及改进的无斜盘机构控制俯仰和滚转。

Result: 显著降低了总功耗，减少了结构重量和振动，通过综合过渡飞行测试验证了稳定的全飞行包线性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的设计有效解决了尾座式无人机在多旋翼模式下的风扰问题，实现了高效、轻量且稳定的飞行性能。

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive
spatial understanding under partial observability to support high-level

lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to
capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a
reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations
with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust
environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's
effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 当前VLA模型参数量庞大，严重依赖大规模机器人数据预训练，导致训练计算成本高、实时推理部署受限，且大多数训练范式会降低视觉语言骨干的感知表示，导致过拟合和泛化能力差。

Conclusion: Evo-1展示了轻量级高效VLA模型的可行性，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和模型权重支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model
weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world

TL;DR: X-Diffusion是一个利用人类视频数据训练机器人扩散策略的框架，通过噪声注入解决人类与机器人执行动作的差异问题，在五个操作任务中平均成功率比最佳基线提高16%。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视频数据易于获取且规模大，是机器人学习的宝贵训练资源。但由于人类与机器人在身体结构上的根本差异，直接的运动重定向会产生物理上不可行的动作。

Method: 利用前向扩散过程：随着噪声添加到动作中，低层执行差异消失而高层任务指导得以保留。首先训练分类器预测噪声动作是由人类还是机器人执行，然后将人类动作仅在添加足够噪声后纳入策略训练。

Result: 实验表明，在存在执行不匹配的情况下，简单的共同训练会降低策略性能，而X-Diffusion始终能提高性能。在五个操作任务中，X-Diffusion实现了比最佳基线高16%的平均成功率。

Conclusion: X-Diffusion提供了一个原则性框架，可以最大限度地利用人类数据而不学习动态不可行的运动，有效解决了人类与机器人动作执行差异的问题。

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website

TL;DR: GentleHumanoid框架将阻抗控制集成到全身运动跟踪策略中，实现上半身柔顺性，通过统一的弹簧模型处理阻力和引导接触，在多种任务中减少峰值接触力并保持任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人需要在以人为中心的环境中安全自然地交互，但现有强化学习策略过于强调刚性跟踪而抑制外力，现有阻抗控制方法局限于基座或末端控制且主要抵抗极端力而非实现柔顺性。

Method: 提出GentleHumanoid框架，核心是统一的基于弹簧的公式化方法，建模阻力接触（按压表面时的恢复力）和引导接触（从人类运动数据采样的推拉动作），确保肩、肘、腕的动力学一致力，同时让策略接触多样交互场景，通过任务可调力阈值支持安全性。

Result: 在仿真和Unitree G1人形机器人上评估，包括轻柔拥抱、坐站辅助和安全物体操作等任务，相比基线方法，策略持续减少峰值接触力同时保持任务成功率，实现更平滑自然的交互。

Conclusion: 该研究朝着能够安全有效与人类协作并在真实环境中处理物体的人形机器人迈出了一步。

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.
